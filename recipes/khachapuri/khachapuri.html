        <h2>Adjaruli Khachapuri Recipe: How to Make Georgian Cheese Bread</h2>
        <p>Adjaruli khachapuri is arguably Georgia’s most iconic dish. This eye-shaped, molten cheese bread is one of the most photogenic, decadent and delicious dishes from Georgia and, along with khinkali, is one of the most sought-after and well-known items of Georgian cuisine. And while it is absolutely delicious to go out to a top restaurant in Tbilisi and dig into a freshly made khachapuri, not everyone can get to Georgia and this delicious dish isn’t easy to find outside of this nation in the Caucasus. It is for this reason that I put together this Adjaruli khachapuri recipe so you can make this Georgian delicacy at home!</p>
        <p>Adjaruli khachapuri (also referred to as Adjarian khachapuri or Acharuli khachapuri) may look complicated to make, however, I assure you that it is actually fairly simple and only requires a handful of ingredients. Not only is it relatively easy to make, but it is also lots of fun! So if you want to travel to Georgia without leaving your own kitchen, make sure to check out this Adjarian khachapuri recipe — you won’t be sorry.</p>
        <h3>What is Khachapuri?</h3>
        <p>Before I dive headfirst into the khachapuri recipe, we need to talk about what this amazing Georgian cheese bread is! Well, there are actually many variations of khachapuri that you can find throughout Georgia and they all hail from their own particular region of this small nation.</p>
        <p>The most well-known (and decadent) of the khachapuris, however, is Adjaruli khachapuri, which hails from the Adjara region in western Georgia — where the coastal city of Batumi is. This is the most distinctive khachapuri and is notable for its boat shape and egg yolk that gives it the look of a cheesy, eggy eye.</p>

        <p>While there are lots of different kinds of khachapuris available in Georgia, the two other most common that you will find (aside from Adjarian khachapuri) are khachapuri Imeruli and khachapuri Megruli. The former comes from the Imereti region around Kutaisi and the latter hails from the Samegrelo region near Zugdidi.</p>
        <p>These two khachapuris differ from Adjaruli khachapuri in the fact that they are circular breads that are fully stuffed with cheese. They aren’t open like the Adjarian khachapuri. Imeruli khachapuri is my personal favourite and the easiest on your stomach and it is simply a circular cheese-stuffed bread. Megruli khachapuri is similar to Imeruli khachapuri except that it is also topped with cheese along with it being stuffed.</p>
        <p>The main takeaway with any kind of khachapuri is that Georgians aren’t shy with the cheese — and neither should you be!</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h4>Dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together milk and yeast until the yeast is dissolved. Set aside until foamy and fragrant, about 5-10 minutes. Add egg and oil and whisk until well combined.</li>
            <li>Combine flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Make a well and pour in wet ingredients. Stir until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a clean work surface and knead until cohesive, supple and smooth, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic or a damp tea towel and let rest at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Assembly</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 220°C (425°F).</li>
            <li>Punch down dough and roll out on a lightly floured surface until it reaches about 35 centimetres (14 inches) in diameter.</li>
            <li>Place cheese in lines at the top and bottom of the dough circle, leaving about 2 centimetres of dough along the edge. Roll each side of dough to the middle of the circle until you have two parallel cheese-filled cylinders.</li>
            <li>Pinch both ends of the dough together very tightly, joining the cylinders at both ends and gently pull them apart in the middle, making an eye-shape and a wide middle. Fill middle with remaining cheese, taking care not to pack it down</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Baking</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Brush each khachapuri with one beaten egg. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet and move to oven. Bake until lightly golden brown, about 12-15 minutes. Pull the khachapuri out and add one egg yolk to the centre of the bread, return to the oven and back for a couple more minutes, or until dark golden brown and cheese is molten and the egg yolk is lightly set but still runny.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a wire rack and top with a pat of butter. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>*If you cannot find Imeruli or sulguni cheese, substitute an equal amount of feta for Imeruli and low-moisture, whole milk mozzarella for the sulguni</p>
